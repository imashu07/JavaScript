// JS is a light-weight, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language.
// Light-Weight - It doesn't take a lot of memory to run the code.
// Cross-platform - JS can easily run on different platforms
// Object-Oriented - Based on OOPs concepts.

// Varibales are like containers storing some value.

Operators include - +, -, *, /, %, =, etc.

e.g. = var sum = num1 + num2 + num3;
